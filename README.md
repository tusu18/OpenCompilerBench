OpenCompBench is a research-driven benchmarking framework designed to evaluate, compare, and intelligently orchestrate machine learning compilers like **TVM**, **TensorRT**, **TFLite**, **ONNX Runtime**, **IREE**, and more.

The project includes:
- 📊 Standardized benchmarks for **vision, NLP, speech, and multimodal models**
- ⚙️ Support for **quantization strategies** (FP32, FP16, INT8)
- 🔁 Construction of **hybrid compiler pipelines** (e.g., TVM for vision, TensorRT for LLMs)
- 🧠 Foundation for a **meta-compiler** to auto-select the best compilation stack

---

## 🚀 Motivation

Deploying foundation models like **LLaMA**, **DeepSeek**, **Whisper**, or **BLIP-2** across diverse hardware platforms — from **A100 GPUs** to **Android phones** to **microcontrollers** — requires **carefully optimized compiler stacks**.

However, today's ecosystem suffers from several pain points:

- ❌ No **universal compiler** works well across models and hardware.
- ❌ Teams rely on **trial-and-error** to find the best compiler+quantization combo.
- ❌ There's a **lack of standardized benchmarks** to guide these decisions.

## ⚠️ Current Problems in Production with ML Compiler Stacks (Detailed Table)

| 🔹 Issue | 💬 Description | 🧠 Real-World Example | 📰 In the News |
|---------|----------------|----------------------|----------------|
| **1. One-size-fits-all Compilers** | Teams pick one compiler (e.g., ONNX + TensorRT) for all models, ignoring model/device differences. | MobileBERT with ONNX on Android is 2× slower than TFLite INT8. TFLite integrates better with Android NNAPI. | Google’s Gemini 1.5 uses mixed compilers (TPU + mobile); Hugging Face supports ONNX, TFLite, TensorRT in Optimum. |
| **2. Inefficient Model–Hardware Match** | Models compiled for GPU often crash or underperform on mobile/edge devices. | Whisper-large compiled for A100 fails on Jetson Nano due to unsupported ops or VRAM limits. | OpenAI Whisper forks exist for TinyML; Edge Impulse and Apple push platform-specific compilers. |
| **3. Long Compilation Cycles** | TVM, AITemplate require hours for model-device tuning, slowing production. | TVM’s Ansor takes 8+ hours to compile ViT on Jetson Orin. | Meta’s AITemplate (used in Stable Diffusion & LLaMA) is fast but takes time to compile. Transfer tuning is a workaround. |
| **4. Manual Trial-and-Error** | Engineers manually test compilers, quantization, batch sizes. | YOLOv8 tested with TensorRT FP16 (unstable), TVM INT8 (accurate), TFLite (mobile). Time-consuming & non-reproducible. | Hugging Face + OpenVINO provide partial automation. NVIDIA Triton still needs manual tuning. |
| **5. Hardware Fragmentation** | Models must be compiled separately for Android, iOS, web, desktop. | AR app with CLIP needs TFLite (Android), CoreML (iOS), ONNX (web), each with separate compilation/testing. | Google uses TFLite, TF.js, XLA; Apple uses CoreML + ANE with custom toolchain. |
| **6. Unpredictable Latency / Memory** | Compilers may cause latency spikes or memory crashes with unsafe quantization. | LLaMA-7B INT8 quantized in TensorRT without calibration drops BLEU from 84 → 68 and spikes memory usage. | NVIDIA advises calibration caches and per-layer tuning. Mistral and Phi-3 focus on safe quantization. |

### 📊 Why Benchmarking + Data Collection Matters

We aim to solve these challenges by building a large-scale dataset that maps:

| Model | Compiler Stack | Quantization | Target Device | Latency | Memory | Accuracy |
|-------|----------------|--------------|----------------|---------|--------|----------|

This **data is the foundation** for building a **Meta-Compiler** — an intelligent system that can:

- 🔍 Predict the best compiler pipeline for any new model/device
- ⚙️ Automatically tune quantization, layout, and batching
- 📦 Output a deployment-ready binary with optimal performance
